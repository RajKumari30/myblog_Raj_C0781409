        Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way. 
        Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open ended thinking 
        and creativity. These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems.
         Skills you learn through sketching can be applied in a number of different areas in your life.

         Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. 
         You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life 
         and career.
