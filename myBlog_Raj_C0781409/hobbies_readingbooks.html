		Reading is a good hobby that will not only improve your imagination but also allows you to escape your daily routine. When you read a good book you can really get lost in the story. A book gives you the chance to escape your daily reality and experience a whole new world!
		Reading a book gives you the opportunity to live experiences that you are not used to. You can really immerse yourself in the story and live the life of the main character in the book. Escape your daily life and get into a whole new one. Be the king of a mighty empire for a day, or feel the rush of investigating a murder case that seems impossible to solve.
 		Feel what the character is feeling, understand his problems and concerns, think outside of your own world.
